 Success with Black depends on seeing beyond the initiative and thinking of positions in terms of potential

 To explain this paradox Watson discusses several different reversed Sicilian lines showing how Black can exploit the disadvantages of

In chess tournaments and matches the frequency with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration 
 In matches the players colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots and alternated thereafter

 The tone of the poem rejects the optimistic pursuit of pleasure found within Keats s earlier poems and rather

 Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song and one morning he took his chair from the

 On inquiry I found those scraps four or five in number contained his poetic feelings on the song of

 These are not the only combination patterns present and there are patterns of two short vowels followed by a
 This reliance on vowel sounds is not unique to this ode but is common to Keats s other odes

 Within Ode to a Nightingale an example of this pattern can be found in line Already with thee tender
 This same pattern is found again in line I cannot see what flowers are at my feet with the
 This system of assonance can be found in approximately a tenth of the lines of Keats s later poetry

 This is not to say that the song is a simple metaphor but it is a complex image that

 brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly Tessa s giving up to be with MacLeod 
 In The Lady and the Tiger she immediately dislikes Amanda played by Elizabeth unk and the script notes that
 Although she quickly earns Amanda s respect Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda while Amanda comments
 Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod s past lovers but acknowledges in Saving Grace that 
 She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him since she fears for his life
 always thought that she would die before MacLeod but when he told her about the Game during The Gathering
 Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use
 Despite being captured by Quince in The Gathering by the time of Band of Brothers she is able to
 Consequently Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship but stays with MacLeod explaining in Eyewitness that
 In For Evil s Sake she tells a guilt ridden MacLeod that You may be Immortal but you re
 Tessa often jokes about MacLeod s immortality for example telling him in For Tomorrow We Die that the last
Tessa is able to unk with others feel as they do think as they do and so become like them
 When MacLeod revealed his immortality to Tessa in Counterfeit Part Two she can show compassion instead of the fear
 Tessa is a very unk and understanding character for example in Saving Grace she is jealous of MacLeod s
Furthermore Tessa demonstrates great courage for example in Mountain Men where she is abducted by three mountain men led by
 Tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them resulting in Cole finally killing one of his own men
 Tessa is a very unk character although it has occasionally been known to put her into rather sticky situations
 Lineberger commented that in See No Evil Tessa gets a taste for how Duncan s life must feel when
 She hits unk with her car telling MacLeod I thought unk the world of evil would feel better than
 was kind of an unusual idea in television in and this was the subject of a lot of meetings
 In Innocent Man when MacLeod refuses to take her where an evil Immortal is she says I know why

 Because Highlander The Series was an international co production the producers cast a French speaking actor to play Tessa
 was able to be exotic pretty and not so unfamiliar to an American audience that she was accepted 
Vandernoot recalled I think I was quite close to Tessa she was very well written very easy to play and
 David Abramowitz creative consultant from the second season onwards said When I saw her and Adrian together I thought
 Paul said that he was detached from the fictional relationship between Tessa and MacLeod but that 
Producer Barry Rosen said We were very lucky that Vandernoot and Kirsch were so human grounded so we could really
 They were also able to get into real life situations romances getting in trouble unk and so on 
 Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age Vandernoot being the older of the two on set
In Vandernoot wanted to leave the show because shooting Highlander was too demanding and required her to spend several months
 a small part of Vandernoot being a really strong actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the
 Panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the Highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found
 have the women be something other than a victim a hostage other things when one is dealing with an
 Consequently the creative staff needed to write Tessa out of the show but were restricted because of the character
 to have a scene where she said Okay I m going to go to Paris without you 
 The writers decided that the only solution was for Tessa to die despite Abramowitz s feeling that her death
 wanted it to be a surprise and show how shocking Tessa s death was to them 
 losing a loved one to a random act of violence isn t something that only happens to television action
 Tessa s death scene shows MacLeod kneeling next to Tessa and unk her then Richie reviving and speaking with
 This scene was later re recorded in Paris in during the filming of the season finale Counterfeit Part Two
 However this footage was not seen in the final version the footage was eventually used in the season four
 The Darkness had the desired effect Lineberger wrote that I was taken aback by the dark tone and emotional
The audience became unk still when in the following episode Eye For An Eye MacLeod made love to Immortal Annie
 It s a thing that pushes you to life and the greatest thing in life that s seize life
 Lineberger wrote in his review of Eye For An Eye This one caused an uproar one I feel is
 When Duncan rolled into Annie s arms part of me unk in appreciation of Duncan s magnetic charm 
 Paul also reported an angry reaction from the audience after the seventh episode The Return of Amanda in which
 It marked the first time that a regular character died in the show it would be followed by the
 It made Highlander the show where you couldn t be positive that the characters were safe because they were
 Lineberger said that Richie and Duncan relate to each other differently from now on and Duncan is bereft of
Tessa remained extremely popular with the audience after her death prompting the producers to develop the season two finale episode
 According to Kirsch Vandernoot did not realize her or her character s popularity before attending conventions 
 Paul said that Vandernoot was surprised that her character had so much influence on the show and that her
 fun for her to do especially to play a different character which was similar to Tessa but also had
 The producers wondered whether the story needed to explain the change in Lisa s voice as she would be
 They considered suggesting that her voice changed because of the surgery then decided that Lisa would have voice training
 After her operation Lisa speaks with Vandernoot s voice when posing as Tessa and with Meilani Paul s voice
Adrian Paul said that Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as a smoker to mark her out as a different character from Tessa
 Paul also said that his unk scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa
 According to Panzer the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter s barge 
 After reading the draft script Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa s
 depicted not as a unk in the dark Lois Lane but rather as a woman who handles her lover
 an unusually unk love interest not to mention a refreshing sexually active heroine as opposed to the coy sexual
 So did Lineberger One gets the feeling they have been together for years though the series is fresh out
 They have healthy banter intense arguments plenty of romance and an easy comfort with each other 
 unk unk of The Denver Post wrote that Paul and Vandernoot don t look like typical American TV style
 she has the poise restraint and grace to be both sensual and frustrated accomplished yet vulnerable mortal but aware
 despite the fact that the having an exact twin of Tessa s pop up is flatly ludicrous it plays
 Vandernoot likes the Tessa character quite a bit and gave me the impression she was sad to see her
 a visit from Tessa in Counterfeit even an evil Tessa look alike is a welcome unk to a significant

 On March he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas xenon hexafluoroplatinate
